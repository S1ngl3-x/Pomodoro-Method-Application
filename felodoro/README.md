# Felodoro

> Pomodoro technique bachelor's thesis

node.js version - 12.16.1

Default database connection config connects to public cluster I have created for quick installation purposes.
Please switch to localhost mongodb if you can. Connection file path: felodoro/server/database/connection.js

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev
Open localhost:3000. Be ware this may result in conflict if you are logged on felodoro.com already.
Opening this in private window is a safe bet.


OPTIONAL
# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```
